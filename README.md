livefft
=======

Basic, recursive FFT implementation showing live mic audio in Python.

It's not very fast. I'm also not 100% sure I'm showing the
magnitude in dB properly -- I'm guessing I would need data about the
hardware in order to do that properly. I would love any tips on that as
well as the sanity of how I'm calculating it.
